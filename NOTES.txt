			*Implementation notes*

*Discussion of NFSv2 readdir*

The readdir call works as follows.  The client sends to the server the
directory which it wants to read, along with a special piece of data
called a cookie.  If the cookie is all zeros, the directory read
operation starts working from the beginning of the directory.  The
server fills in a data buffer with directory entries.  Each entry has
a cookie associated with it.  The cookie is basically a pointer to the
_next_ entry.  The server puts as much data into the buffer as it can.
If the buffer fills up, the readdir operation returns w/ a "more data"
indicator.  If the client sees this indicator, it makes a note of the
cookie for the last entry it received.  Since the cookie points to the
next entry, the client can use that cookie to make another readdir
call that starts w/ that next entry.  Repeating this until the "more
data" indicator is no longer set, a client can read the entire
directory contents.

This is all great unless the directory incurs a change between readdir
calls.  If a directory changes between readdir calls, a cookie that a
client is holding may become invalid.  NFSv2 provides no way for a
server to indicate to a client that its cookie is no longer any good.

This situation can happen quite easily when the 'rm -r' command is
used on the client to delete a directory tree on the server.  rm -r is
typically implemented like so:

char buf[bufsize];

/* depth first! */
while (getdents(directory_fd, buf, bufsize)) {
     foreach entry (buf)  {
        if (directoryp entry) 
           rm_recursive(entry)
        else
           unlink(entry);
     }
}

The getdents syscall call eventually boils down to a readdir call.
Depending on how large 'bufsize' is, getdents calls (thus readdir
calls) may be interspersed with unlink calls.  This means that the
directory is changing as it is being read in small pieces.  This can
lead to the rm -r command getting confused and not completing
correctly.  

You've probably never experienced this problem w/ Unix NFS servers.  I
believe the reason for this is:
  1) Those NFS servers are kernel-mode software.
  2) The NFS readdir call was designed w/ Unix filesystems in mind.

Typical Unix filesystems store directories as just a special form of a
regular file.  The file contains variable-length records.  The records
are entries in the directory.  An example follows:

directory:
offset  0: filea
offset 10: fileb
offset 20: filec 

Some of these records may be empty.  An empty record would result if,
say, 'filea' were unlinked from the above example.  Instead of
shifting all the entries down, the 'filea' entry is just marked as
unused.  This saves time... and also gives rise to why rm -r works
fine w/ Unix NFS servers.

User-mode programs generally don't see this low-level structure of
directories, but kernel-mode programs (thus Unix NFS servers) do.  The
directory offsets in the above example make perfect cookies for the
readdir call.  A readdir call using the above example might return:

filea  cookie: 10
fileb  cookie: 20
filec  cookie: xxxx (end of listing)

(recall: the cookie for an entry identifies the entry that follows)

Even if rm -r only read and unlinked one directory entry per loop, it
would work fine becauses the actual directory contents don't shift
when an unlink occurs, therefore the cookies wouldn't shift.


The NFS project that you are dealing with now is not a Unix kernel-
mode program.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  It's a lowly user-mode
Windows program.  It is likely that FAT and/or NTFS filesystems, like
their Unix filesystem counterparts, don't shift directory contents
when unlinking files... but unfortunately we can't get at the raw
directory information easily (at least, not as far as I can tell).
This makes cookie selection difficult.

This program uses the lisp (directory) function to read the contents
of a directory to respond to a 'readdir' call.  To combat the 'rm -r'
issue, the following things were done.

1) Calls to (directory) are cached for *nfs-dircachereaptime*
   (defaults to 5) seconds.   The cache contains the contents of the
   directory, along with a timestamp.
2) NFS operations that modify a directory (unlink, create, rename)
   will be recorded in the directory cache (as long as they occur
   within *nfs-dircachereaptime* of the last operation).
3) The unlink operation doesn't shift the contents of the directory
   listing.  Instead, it just sets the corresponding entry to nil.
   The code that handles the readdir call knows to ignore these
   entries.
4) The cookies that the readdir handler uses are indexes into the
   cached directory listing.

This caching of (directory) calls also has the side effect of making
the operations a bit faster.

For an rm -r to work w/o problems, *nfs-dircachereaptime* must be
large enough to keep the directory contents cached while rm -r
descends through subdirectories.  You can adjust this parameter if you
are having problems.

Note that while a directory listing is cached, any changes to the
directory made by a local user on the NFS server will not be visible
to the NFS client for *nfs-dircachereaptime* seconds.  You'll want to
adjust *nfs-dircachereaptime* to balance between rm -r success and
confusion avoidance.

*Other information caching*

The NFS protocol doesn't have an 'open' call.  Clients simply make
read and write calls to files.  A basic implementation of a user-mode
NFS server would have to open the file, do the read or write
operation, then close the file.... for every block of data.  

To avoid this potential constant opening and closing of the file, this
NFS server employs and open file cache.  A parameter
*openfilereaptime* (defaults to 2) controls how long files are held
open after their last use.  The default value should be fine for most
people but you may want to make an adjustment if your situation calls
for it.  Just remember that a file will stay open *openfilereaptime*
seconds longer than the last access to it.

Similarly, calls to stat() are cached for *statcachereaptime* seconds.
Most NFS calls return information from the stat() call.  Keep this in
mind if you edit a file or directory locally on the NFS server.  NFS
clients may not see the change for up to *statcachereaptime* seconds.

Note that *statcachereaptime* should be larger than
*openfilereaptime*.  This is is because the open file reaper needs to
cached stat information when closing a file that was opened for
writing.
