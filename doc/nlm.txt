Network Lock Manager Protocol

Introduction

The Network Lock Manager (NLM) is a service that provides advisory
X/Open CAE file and record locking, and DOS compatible file sharing
and locking in an XNFS environment. Here, DOS refers to MS-DOS or PC
DOS, and DOS file sharing and record locking is as defined in Disk
Operating System Technical Reference, IBM part no. 6138536.

Versions

There are multiple versions of the NLM. This document describes
version 3 which is backward compatible with versions 1 and 2.

Synchronization of NLMs  

Due to the stateless nature of XNFS servers it is difficult to
incorporate a stateful service. The NLM relies on the server holding
the locks as the keeper of the state and on the NSM for information on
host status (monitored locks only). When an XNFS server crashes and is
rebooted, locks which it had granted may be recreated by the lock
holders (clients) during a grace period. During this grace period no
new locks are accepted although NFS requests are accepted.  The
duration of this grace period is implementation-dependent; 45 seconds
is common.

DOS-Compatible File-Sharing Support

Version 3 of the protocol supports DOS compatible file locking and sharing.
File sharing is a mechanism which allows a DOS process to open or create a file
and to restrict the way in which subsequent processes may access the file. For
example, a DOS client may request that a file is opened for reading and
writing, and that subsequent users may only open it for reading. To use a DOS
sharing mode an NLM_SHARE request is issued when a file is opened, and a
corresponding NLM_UNSHARE is performed when it is closed. These procedures rely
on the nlm_share structure, defined below. Because the sharing requests were
intended to be used by a single-tasking client host, they are non-monitored.

RPC Information

Authentication

The NLM service uses AUTH_UNIX style authentication only.

Transport Protocols

The NLM Protocol supports both UDP/IP and TCP/IP transports. However, a client
implementation may choose to only generate requests over the UDP/IP protocol.

Port Number

Consult the server's port mapper, described in Port_Mapper_Protocol, to find
the port number on which the NLM service is registered.

Sizes of XDR Structures

These are the sizes, given in decimal bytes, of various XDR structures used in
the protocol.


      /* The maximum length of the string identifying the caller. */
      const LM_MAXSTRLEN = 1024;

      /* The maximum number of bytes in the nlm_notify name argument. */
      const LM_MAXNAMELEN = LM_MAXSTRLEN+1;

      const MAXNETOBJ_SZ = 1024;

Basic Data Types for Locking

The following XDR definitions are the basic structures and types used in the
parameters passed to, and returned from, the NLM.
netobj

      opaque netobj<MAXNETOBJ_SZ>

Netobj is used to identify an object, generally a transaction, owner or file.
The contents and form of the netobj are defined by the client.
nlm_stats

      enum nlm_stats {
          LCK_GRANTED = 0,
          LCK_DENIED = 1,
          LCK_DENIED_NOLOCKS = 2,
          LCK_BLOCKED = 3,
          LCK_DENIED_GRACE_PERIOD = 4
      };

Nlm_stats are returned whenever the NLM is called upon to create or test a lock
on a file.
  LCK_GRANTED
      Indicates that the procedure call completed successfully.
  LCK_DENIED
      Indicates that the request failed.
  LCK_DENIED_NOLOCKS

      Indicates that the procedure call failed because the server NLM could not
      allocate the resources needed to process the request.
  LCK_BLOCKED
      Indicates the blocking request cannot be granted immediately. The server
      NLM will make a call-back to the client with an NLM_GRANTED procedure
      call when the lock can be granted.
  LCK_DENIED_GRACE_PERIOD

      Indicates that the procedure call failed because the server has recently
      been rebooted and the server NLM is re-establishing existing locks, and
      is not yet ready to accept normal service requests.

Note that some versions of NFS source may use mixed or lower-case names for the
enumeration constants in "nlm_stats".

nlm_stat

      struct nlm_stat {
          nlm_stats stat;
      };

This structure returns lock status. It is used in many of the other data
structures.

nlm_res
      struct nlm_res {
          netobj cookie;
          nlm_stat stat;
      };

The nlm_res structure is returned by all of the main lock routines except for
NLM_TEST which has a separate return structure defined below. Note that clients
must not rely upon the "cookie" being the same as that passed in the
corresponding request.
nlm_holder



      struct nlm_holder {
          bool exclusive;
          int uppid;
          netobj oh;
          unsigned l_offset;
          unsigned l_len;
      };

The nlm_holder structure identifies the holder of a particular lock. It is used
as part of the return value from the NLM_TEST procedure. The boolean
"exclusive" indicates whether the lock is exclusively held by the
current holder. The integer "uppid" provides a unique per-process
identifier for lock differentiation. The values "l_offset" and
"l_len" define the region of the file locked by this holder. The
"oh" field is an opaque object that identifies the host, or a process
on the host, that is holding the lock.
nlm_testrply



      union nlm_testrply switch (nlm_stats stat) {
          case LCK_DENIED:
              struct nlm_holder holder;    /*  holder of the lock */
          default:
              void;
      };

The nlm_testrply is used as part of the return value from the NLM_TEST
procedure. If the lock specified in the NLM_TEST procedure call would conflict
with a previously granted lock, information on the holder of the lock is
returned in "holder", otherwise just the status is returned.
nlm_testres



      struct nlm_testres {
          netobj cookie;
          nlm_testrply test_stat;
      };

This structure is the return value from the NLM_TEST procedure. The other main
lock routines return the nlm_res structure.
nlm_lock



      struct nlm_lock {
          string caller_name<LM_MAXSTRLEN>;
          netobj fh;         /*  identify a file  */
          netobj oh;         /*  identify owner of a lock  */
          int uppid;         /*  Unique process identifier  */
          unsigned l_offset; /*  File offset (for record locking) */
          unsigned l_len;    /*  Length (size of record)  */
      };

The nlm_lock structure defines the information needed to uniquely specify a
lock. The "caller_name" uniquely identifies the host making the call.
The "fh" field identifies the file to lock. The "oh" field
is an opaque object that identifies the host, or a process on the host, that is
making the request. "uppid" uniquely describes the process owning the
file on the calling host. The "uppid" may be generated in any system-
dependent fashion. On an X/Open-compliant system it is generally the process
ID. On a DOS system it may be generated from the program segment prefix (PSP).
The "l_offset" and "l_len" determine which bytes of the
file are locked.
nlm_lockargs



      struct nlm_lockargs {
          netobj cookie;
          bool block;            /*  Flag to indicate blocking behaviour. */
          bool exclusive;        /*  If exclusive access is desired. */
          struct nlm_lock alock; /*  The actual lock data (see above) */
          bool reclaim;          /*  used for recovering locks  */
          int state;             /*  specify local NSM state  */
      };

The nlm_lockargs structure defines the information needed to request a lock on
a server. The "block" field must be set to true if the client wishes
the procedure call to block until the lock can be granted (see NLM_LOCK). A
false value will cause the procedure call to return immediately if the lock
cannot be granted. The "reclaim" field must only be set to true if
the client is attempting to reclaim a lock held by an NLM which has been
restarted (due to a server crash, and so on). The "state" field is
used with the monitored lock procedure call (NLM_LOCK). It is the state value
supplied by the local NSM, see Network_Status_Monitor_Protocol.
nlm_cancargs



      struct nlm_cancargs {
          netobj cookie;
          bool block;
          bool exclusive;
          struct nlm_lock alock;
      };

The nlm_cancargs structure defines the information needed to cancel an
outstanding lock request. The data in the nlm_cancargs structure must exactly
match the corresponding information in the nlm_lockargs structure of the
outstanding lock request to be cancelled.
nlm_testargs



      struct nlm_testargs {
          netobj cookie;
          bool exclusive;
          struct nlm_lock alock;
      };

The nlm_testargs structure defines the information needed to test a lock. The
information in this structure is the same as the corresponding fields in the
nlm_lockargs structure.
nlm_unlockargs



      struct nlm_unlockargs {
          netobj cookie;
          struct nlm_lock alock;
      };

The nlm_unlockargs structure defines the information needed to remove a
previously established lock.

DOS File-Sharing Data Types

The following data types are used in version 3 of the NLM to support DOS 3.1
and above compatible file-sharing control. All file-sharing procedure calls are
non-monitored.
fsh_mode



      enum fsh_mode {
          fsm_DN = 0,        /*  deny none  */
          fsm_DR = 1,        /*  deny read  */
          fsm_DW = 2,        /*  deny write  */
          fsm_DRW = 3        /*  deny read/write  */
      };

fsh_mode defines the legal sharing modes.
fsh_access



      enum fsh_access {
          fsa_NONE = 0,     /*  for completeness  */
          fsa_R = 1,        /*  read-only  */
          fsa_W = 2,        /*  write-only  */
          fsa_RW = 3        /*  read/write  */
      };

fsh_access defines the legal file access modes.
nlm_share



      struct nlm_share {
          string caller_name<LM_MAXSTRLEN>;
          netobj fh;
          netobj oh;
          fsh_mode mode;
          fsh_access access;
      };

The nlm_share structure defines the information needed to uniquely specify a
share operation. The netobj's define the file. "fh" and owner
"oh", "caller_name" uniquely identifies the host.
"mode" and "access" define the file-sharing and the access
modes.
nlm_shareargs



      struct nlm_shareargs {
          netobj cookie;
          nlm_share share;     /*  actual share data  */
          bool reclaim;        /*  used for recovering shares  */
      };

This structure encodes the arguments for an NLM_SHARE or NLM_UNSHARE procedure
call. The boolean "reclaim" must be true if the client is attempting
to reclaim a previously-granted sharing request, and false otherwise.
nlm_shareres



      struct nlm_shareres {
          netobj cookie;
          nlm_stats stat;
          int sequence;
      };

This structure encodes the results of an NLM_SHARE or NLM_UNSHARE procedure
call. The "cookie" and "sequence" fields should be ignored;
they are required only for compatibility reasons. The result of the request is
given by "stat".
nlm_notify


      struct nlm_notify {
          string name<LM_MAXNAMELEN>;
          long state;
      };

This structure encodes the arguments for releasing all locks and shares a
client holds.


NLM Procedures

The following reference pages define the protocol used by the NLM using RPC
Language. Version 3 of the protocol is the same as version 1 and 2 with the
addition of the non-monitored locking procedures and the DOS compatible sharing
procedures.


      /*
       * NLM procedures
       */

      program NLM_PROG {
          version NLM_VERSX {
              /*
               *  synchronous procedures
               */
              void         NLM_NULL(void) = 0;
              nlm_testres  NLM_TEST(struct nlm_testargs) = 1;
              nlm_res      NLM_LOCK(struct nlm_lockargs) = 2;
              nlm_res      NLM_CANCEL(struct nlm_cancargs) = 3;
              nlm_res      NLM_UNLOCK(struct nlm_unlockargs) = 4;

              /*
               *  server   NLM call-back procedure to grant lock
               */
              nlm_res      NLM_GRANTED(struct nlm_testargs) = 5;

              /*
               *  asynchronous requests and responses
               */
              void         NLM_TEST_MSG(struct nlm_testargs) = 6;
              void         NLM_LOCK_MSG(struct nlm_lockargs) = 7;
              void         NLM_CANCEL_MSG(struct nlm_cancargs) =8;
              void         NLM_UNLOCK_MSG(struct nlm_unlockargs) = 9;
              void         NLM_GRANTED_MSG(struct nlm_testargs) = 10;
              void         NLM_TEST_RES(nlm_testres) = 11;
              void         NLM_LOCK_RES(nlm_res) = 12;
              void         NLM_CANCEL_RES(nlm_res) = 13;
              void         NLM_UNLOCK_RES(nlm_res) = 14;
              void         NLM_GRANTED_RES(nlm_res) = 15;

              /*
               *  synchronous non-monitored lock and DOS file-sharing
               *  procedures (not defined for version 1 and 2)
               */
              nlm_shareres NLM_SHARE(nlm_shareargs) = 20;
              nlm_shareres NLM_UNSHARE(nlm_shareargs) = 21;
              nlm_res      NLM_NM_LOCK(nlm_lockargs) = 22;
              void         NLM_FREE_ALL(nlm_notify) = 23;
          } = 3;
      } = 100021;

The NLM provides synchronous and asynchronous procedures which provide the same
functionality. The client portion of an NLM may choose to implement locking and
file-sharing functionality by using either set of procedure calls.

The server portion of an NLM implementation must support both the synchronous
and asynchronous procedures.

The asynchronous procedures implement a message passing scheme to facilitate
asynchronous handling of locking and unlocking. Each of the functions Test,
Lock, Unlock and Grant is broken up into a message part, and a result part. An
NLM will send a message to another NLM to perform some action. The receiving
NLM will queue the request, and when it is dequeued and completed, will send
the appropriate result via the result procedure. For example an NLM may send an
NLM_LOCK_MSG and will expect an NLM_LOCK_RES in return. These functions have
the same functionality and parameters as the synchronous procedures.

Note that most NLM implementations do not send RPC-layer replies to
asynchronous procedures. When a client sends an NLM_LOCK_MSG call, for example,
it should not expect an RPC reply with the corresponding xid. Instead, it must
expect an NLM_LOCK_RES call from the server. The server should not expect an
RPC reply to the NLM_LOCK_RES call.
